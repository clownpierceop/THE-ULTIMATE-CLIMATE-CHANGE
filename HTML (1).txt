<p><h2>since the industrial revoultiton, humans have released
over 1.5tillion tons of carbon , into the Eath's atmosphere
in the year 2019,we were still pumping out around 37 billion more that's 50 percent more than the year 2000 and almost three times much as 50 years ago
 and it's not just carbon we're also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide
  combining all of our greenhouse gases, we;re emitting 51 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year.</h2></p>

<p><h2>and emissions keep rising but they need to get down to zero in the recent years, the consequences have become more serious and visible
almost every year breakes some horrible record: we've had more heat waves, the most glaciers melting, and the lowest amount of ice ever recorded at the north pole
 of the last 22 years, 20 have been the hottest on record
 the only way to limit this rapid climate change is to decrease our collective emissions quickly.</h2></p>

 <br>
<p><h2> but although all countries agree on this goal in principal, they do not agree who is responsible or who should bear the heaviest load 
the developed countries point at their own efforts to reduce emissions and the fact that large developing countries on the rise, especially china,
are currently releasing much more carbon on the other hand, developing countries argue that emissions by the west are lifestyle emissions
while for developing countries, they are survival emissions others call rich hypocrites that got rich by polluting without restraint and now expect others not to industrialize and stay poor
so who is responsible for climate chnage and carbon emissions. </h2"></p>

<p><h2> </h2>and regardless of the past, who needs to do the most today? int this website we are gona ans your  three questions </h2></p>
<br>
<p><h1> which countries emit the most carbon dioxide today?</h1>
<h2>in 2017, humans emitted about 36 billion tons of carbon more than 50% came from asia. North america and europe fallowed with 18% and 17%
while africa, south america, oceania together only contributed eight percent in the recent years china is by far the world,s largest emitter with 10 billion tons of carbon every year
its fallowed by the usa with 15% and the european union with around 10% next on our list is our great india at 7%, russia at 5%, japan at 3%
with all of them combined the are 75% of the pollution rest is by the world at 25%.</h2></p>
<br>
<br>
<p><h1>which country emitted the most in total?</h1>
<h2>if we look at emissions throughout histry until today, the outcome changes dresticallythe us and the eu both knock china off the top spot the us is responsible for 15% of the wrold's histroical emissions out of 1.58 trillion tons 
emitting 400billion tons in 20th century emittting around 290 billion tons at the second place is eu at 22% china comes at 13% at the half emittion of the world india contributed 3% with the whole africa.</h2></p>
<p><h2> so the narrative that climate change is really the responsibiliy of the developing world. </h2></p>
